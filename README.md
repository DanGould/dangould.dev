# Dan Gould's portfolio site

Currently, It's a static page with a bit of a physics game.

I'd like to expand to a short-form blog. That requires hooking up a database and defining posts. Posts are collections of media with a title, featured bit (photo, clip, quote), and body content. I'm not sure if I want blog posts to be dated.

The home page should show a preview of the most recent piece of content and link to the list of everything.

Comments can be enabled through dissenter to start. Then through email vailidation & my personal moderation.

My final goal would be for the site to be bilinguial.

Pie in the sky goal would be experimental + social + lightning network powered features. No username/password auth, but possibly email 1-time-auth. If participants can contribute via a micropayment, or invoice that would be sweet.

I think A post of resources could be helpful as well.
