          I worked alongside Stratis Platform developers as well as Boston University scholars to apply the technology to the commercial blockchain space.

          University scholars' and companies' idea of the best outcomes for a project differ wildly. As a working Liason, I carry out integration tests to ensure the protocol behaves as advertised in the paper. I also facilitate communicate between the two teams so the protocol suite maintains balance between user and company incentives while retaining the integrity of the original work..

          This is a simple, budget-oriented, rapidly constructed portfolio website for a unique
          visual artist from New York. It is a good example of a client site
          which the owner can maintain on their own while utilizing my design and
          development skills to adjust an off-the-shelf WordPress theme to their own individual needs.

          Tony had all of his content and ideas ready before we began development which made the
          process straightforward. All alterations needed to stay mobile-responsive and look good
          on a desktop computer as the original theme did. Large photos needed to be compressed to improve
          performance of the site.
          Tony's preparation of content and clear idea of budget from the outset fostered a successful original outcome and lasting business relationship.

          This is a responsive WordPress website built to fit the developing needs of my local
          fire department. The chief can now post images and stories as well as other event
          updates on his own without the need for a trained webmaster. The custom theme
          fits the department's aesthetic. The site enables integration of published posts with
          the department's popular Facebook page. It was built exclusively on volunteer hours as my Eagle Scout
          Service project.

          Because of the nature of the service project, I had to incorporate
          copy, visual, and software comonents created by youth and adult volunteers. This involved
          educating volunteers about web practices and technologies as well as communicating with the town and department to meet their needs.

          This is a responsive WordPress website built quickly and inexpensively for a small business in the Berkshires. I was responsible for design, graphics, and development of the site. The site was built to serve the needs of a CAD shop and allow them to update their own content.

          I was not very familiar with CSS during this project so I struggeled to lay out things centered and create a mobile responsive design. I gained a lot of familiarity with CSS3 through this project and also learned how to alter basic PHP to add functionality like the contact form.
